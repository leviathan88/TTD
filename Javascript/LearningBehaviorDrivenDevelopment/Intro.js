As a summary, the following are the five rules of the test-first approach:

•Don't write any new tests if there is not a new coding task.
•A new test must always fail.
•A new test should be as simple as possible.
•Write only the minimum necessary code to fix a failing test, and don't bother with quality during this activity.
•You can only clean or redesign your code if all the tests pass. Try to do it in each cycle if possible.
